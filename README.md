DCPU Stress Test
================

The included "GenerateStressTest" program will generate files of DCPU assembly that represent all
possible instructions in all forms.  It should be assembler-ambiguous, and all assemblers should
be able to assemble is with no errors, only warnings (for redundancy and literal assignment).

Each file is less than 10,001 lines long.  If you wish to include your results, submit a pull
request and it will be added.
